# Abstract

The goal of this project is to create a bidirectional synchronization system that will make it easier for Salesforce and a relational database system—such as MySQL—to exchange account data. The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) protocol is utilized by the system to create an effective and smooth communication channel between these different data repositories. Define mapping rules, set criteria for synchronization event triggering, and configure data fields for synchronization are some of the key features (Organization, 2019).The system offers flexibility in data synchronization procedures by supporting Salesforce outbound messaging as well as polling mechanisms. To improve data selection efficiency and guarantee that only current and pertinent data is transferred between Salesforce and the database system, it also uses watermarking techniques. Organizations can achieve a high degree of configurability in managing their data integration processes by utilizing this bidirectional synchronization system, contributing to improved interoperability and data consistency between Salesforce and relational databases. The use of the JDBC protocol ensures communication infrastructure compatibility and reliability, making the synchronization system a strong solution for maintaining coherent and up-to-date account data across platforms. (Organization, 2019)

# Problem Description

In today's business environment, organizations frequently rely on a variety of software systems to manage and utilize critical data.
